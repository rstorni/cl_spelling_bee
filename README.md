# Command Line New York Times Spelling Bee

## Overview

This project implements a command-line version of the popular New York Times Spelling Bee game. Players are challenged to create as many words as possible from a given set of letters, with the condition that each word must include a particular "key" letter. This Python-based game offers a robust command-line interface for playing, managing game states, and includes features such as saving and loading game sessions.

## Features

- **Random Letter Generation:** Each game session starts with a randomly generated set of letters, including a mandatory key letter.
- **Save/Load Game:** Players can save their current game state to a file and load it later to continue their session.
- **Score Tracking:** The game calculates scores based on the length of the words created, encouraging players to find longer and more complex words.
- **Dictionary Validation:** Words are validated against a comprehensive dictionary file to ensure that only real words are counted.
